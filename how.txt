Create a file CMakeLists.txt (the name is important) together with your source hi.cpp
{
project("hi")

add_executable( hi hi.cpp )
}



Then compile and run as:

cmake -B <path_to_build_folder> -S <path_to_source_folder>
cmake --build <path_to_build_folder>
cd <path_to_build_folder>; ./hi




g++ file_name.cpp -o executable_file_name
